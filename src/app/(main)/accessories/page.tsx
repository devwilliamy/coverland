        Be prepared for any eventuality with an Emergency Escape Tool. For
        example, this tool can quickly break the glass for a safe escape in a
        vehicle submersion or fire. This multi-use tool can break glass, cut
        through a seat belt, and hammer away. If the seatbelts do not unlock,
        the sharp blade can cut through all passenger{"'"}s seatbelts allowing
        for a quick escape. In the event of a fire or water hazard, the safety
        hammer can break the glass with the sharp tip, and the flat end can
        knock out any remaining jagged glass. Install this safety hammer in the
        car with the included screw or hold it in place with double-sided
        adhesive. In case of emergency, you should always keep this safety
        hammer within easy reach of the driver.
